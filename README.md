## Introduction

Decentralized Library is a blockchain-based application that allows users to add, borrow, and return books in a decentralized manner. The application utilizes Ethereum smart contracts to manage book data and ensure secure transactions.


## Features

* **Decentralized Book Management**: Add, borrow, and return books in a decentralized manner.
* **Smart Contract-based**: Utilizes Ethereum smart contracts to manage book data and ensure secure transactions.
* **Web3.js Integration**: Built using Web3.js to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.


## Requirements

* **Node.js**: Version 14 or higher.
* **Web3.js**: Version 1.7.4 or higher.
* **Ethereum Wallet**: A compatible Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask).


## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/decentralized-library.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Start the application: `npm start` or `yarn start`


## Usage

1. Connect to the Ethereum network using a compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
